## Hi, I’m Will Gosnold!

- I'm having a great time on my data science and software development journey, and have been teaching myself coding from various online resources over the couple of years.

- Here you can find some of the projects I've been working on to get an idea of where I'm currently at.

- If you want to contact me, you can reach out on Twitter @willgosnold
